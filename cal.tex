\textbf{WHEREAS}, Corporation anticipates making rooms in the property available to college students associated with the Chapter; and

                Corporation recognizes that the Empty Bed Fee and Parlor Fee may be recouped by Chapter by cimposing a direct charge on all of its members who have not executed Room License Agreements and Corporation further agrees to cooperate with Chapter in imposing such charges, so long as at not cost, expense, or liability to Corporation.
                Notwithstanding the foregoin, as between Corporation and Chapter, Chapter shall be solely and exclusively responsible for paying said Fees.

        \item The Empty Bed Fee owed by Chapter to Corporation pursuent to the Agreement will be provided by written notice to Chapter by May 15 of each academic year or as soon thereafter as the occupancy of the Property is known.
                The Empty Bed Fee shall be paid by Chapter to Corporation in installments equal agreed upon between Chapter and Corporation.
